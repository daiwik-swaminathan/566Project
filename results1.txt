=== CNN Classifier Results (Highlight vs. Non-Highlight Audio Clips) ===

Dataset:
- 27 NBA highlights
- 27 NBA non-highlights

--- Training Loss ---
Epoch 1/30 - Loss: 101.0388
Epoch 2/30 - Loss: 41.5654
Epoch 3/30 - Loss: 3.4539
Epoch 4/30 - Loss: 0.1057
Epoch 5/30 - Loss: 0.0036
...
Epoch 30/30 - Loss: 0.0002

The model quickly reduced training loss to near-zero, which strongly suggests overfitting â€” it memorized the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. This is common with small datasets.

--- Test Set Performance (11 samples) ---
Accuracy: 73%
Precision, Recall, F1-score:

Class 0 (Non-Highlight)
- Precision: 0.71
- Recall:    0.83
- F1-Score:  0.77

Class 1 (Highlight)
- Precision: 0.75
- Recall:    0.60
- F1-Score:  0.67

Macro Average F1: 0.72

--- Confusion Matrix ---
[[5 1]
 [2 3]]

Interpretation:
- Correctly predicted 5 non-highlights (True Negatives)
- Incorrectly predicted 1 non-highlight as a highlight (False Positive)
- Missed 2 actual highlights (False Negatives)
- Correctly predicted 3 highlights (True Positives)

Overall, the model performs slightly better at identifying non-highlight clips. It struggles more with catching all highlights, which is reflected in the lower recall for class 1.

--- Next Steps / Suggestions ---
1. Add validation loss tracking to monitor overfitting.
2. Plot predictions and sample spectrograms to inspect failure cases.
3. Try basic audio augmentations to help the model generalize.
4. Experiment with different input features (MFCCs, UMAP, etc.).
5. Use cross-validation to evaluate the model more reliably given the small test set.

This run was a strong first result, and the model is functioning correctly.
